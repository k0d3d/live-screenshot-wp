# Live Screenshots for Wordpress!

Have you ever wanted to use a portion or segment of another website on your own website?

Sometimes Wordpress designers want to insert *live scores* or *Forex* charts on a Wordpress site but the source website does not provide any copy-and-paste widgets.

## Easy to use.

 1. Install the Wordpress plugin -> Live Screenshots
 2. Active the plugin
 3. Set the configuration options at Settings -> Live Screenshot
 4. Place your screenshot in a Widget Area or use a shortcode
